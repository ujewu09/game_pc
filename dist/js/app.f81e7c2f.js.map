<p>1、进行中游戏下单是指对正在进行比赛进行下单。订单会在赛事进行期间继续收订单并且在关闭预测后停止收单。注意：但凡赛事已经移到进行中游戏页面，不管赛事是否已经开始，系统即将所有下单计算为进行中游戏订单。</p>\r\n            <h6>1.1、所有进行中游戏下单均需经过系统验收程序。这可能会导致每笔下单延迟确认或出现下单失败的情况。</h6>\r\n            <h6>1.2、所有订单会在35秒内等待系统验收程序判断下单是否成功。这表示订单有可能被取消或确认。</h6>\r\n            <h6>1.3、在赛事进行中发生技术问题或其他特殊情况，所有待确认中的订单将不被确认并视为下单失败。</h6>\r\n            <h6>1.4、所有在进行中游戏下单所显示的资料（包括比分及时间等等）均只是一个参考，所有信息均不会用作结算的依据，也不应基于此作为下单的根据。</h6>\r\n            <p>2、时间大小预测按照比赛结束的实际时间/官方数据为准，如果比赛结果刚好是预测开出的时间，结算方式为下单在小预测判“负”而下单在大预测判“胜”。例如：>39如果比赛时间小于39分钟，则结算为小，如果比赛时间大于39分钟，则结算为大。如果比赛结果刚好是39分钟，则下单在小于39分钟判“负”，下单在大于39分钟判“胜”。</p>\r\n            <p>3、杀敌数将以游戏内记分板为主要依据。当有重要证据证明游戏数据有误时,我们将依据相关独立资料进行结算。</p>\r\n            <p>4、一血是以记分板为依据，拿下第一分便是一血。</p>\r\n            <p>5、英雄联盟-猜第N条元素龙属性-当一条元素龙被击杀之后，崖壁上会显示下一条元素龙的属性，只要预告了就是代表已经有结果了。</p>\r\n            <p>6、第N次击杀：是指那一队刚好获得第N次的击杀。例如：第十次击杀：是指哪一方获得第十次的击杀。</p>\r\n            <p>7、N杀:是指一方率先获得版面的N次的击杀数。例如：十杀:是指一方率先获得十个击杀数。</p>\r\n            <p>8、CSGO炸弹类预测定义：无论有无安装/拆除炸弹都会进行结算。</p>\r\n            <p>9、首座防御塔/炮塔/兵营下单预测指的是以哪一个队伍先拿下第一层首座防御塔/炮塔或首座兵营。若其一方队伍反补，或被对方小兵攻破，全部下单仍视为有效。</p>\r\n            <p>10、所有电子竞技下单之赛果认定皆以本公司所订定之规则为准。</p>\r\n            <p>11、我们有权收回多支付给您的任何竞猜币，并调整您的账户，以纠正错误。任何因错误而被记入您的账户，或向您支付的竞猜币，基于我们对您的信赖而由您保管并应在我们要求返还时偿还。如果您的账户中存有竞猜币，我们可以从您的账户中直接扣除此竞猜币且会在合理可行的范围内尽快通知您。</p>\r\n            <p>12、您发现任何错误时，应尽快通知我们。如果您使用我们因错误而记入您的账户或向您支付的竞猜币进行下单或游戏，我们又取消这些下单和/或扣留您使用这笔竞猜币而获得的奖金。如果我们已经向您支付任何此类下单或游戏的奖金，这笔竞猜币应被视为基于我们对您的信赖而由您保管，您应在我们要求您付款时立即向我们偿还这笔竞猜币。</p>\r\n            <p>13、开心电竞保留因为不同原因去拒绝全部或部份下单的权利，当一个下单确定了之后，除非有特别的情况，则便不能更改或取消。我们同样保留关掉任何账户的权利而不会说明原因。</p>\r\n            <p>14、我们在尽一切方法确保信息正确，但于此同时，如果一项赛事如有任何错误的信息，开心电竞将不会对此承担任何责任。</p>\r\n            <p>15、所有电子竞技下单之赛果依照各官方裁定为最终赛果。当官方比分提供商或官方网站不存在或有重要证据证明官方比分提供商或官方网站的数据有误时，我们将依据相关独立资料进行结算。</p>\r\n            <p>16、对于已经结算完的比赛，由于不可抗力因素造成赛后对该比赛进行重新判罚，开心电竞将不做参考，按照已经完成的比赛事实进行结算。</p>\r\n            <p>17、如果选手或战队更改了名称，只要可以确定下单对象是哪一场或哪一局赛事，使用之前名称提供的预测全部生效。下单不会因团队有替补或暂代队员参加比赛而取消。如果比赛的组织机构允许有替补队员且公布官方的比赛结果，所有下单将被视为正常。</p>\r\n            <p>18、如果一支队伍更改名字但是阵容一样，那么在比赛期间，所有下单于新队名称以及旧队名均有效。但如果一支队伍被全新的阵容以及每个玩家都不同于原来的参赛队取代，则所有的下单将被视为无效。（超过一个队员不一样既视为无效）</p>\r\n            <p>19、如果选手或战队的名字出现了拼写错误，只要可以认定下单对象是哪一局或哪一场，所有下单全部生效。</p>\r\n            <p>20、如果因选手退赛或被取消参赛资格而导致赛局没有完赛，有关比赛已有明确结果的所有下单将继续有效。因没有完成预定的赛局，导致无法满足结算条件的订单，如：所有输赢预测、让分预测和总分下单将被取消。</p>\r\n            <p>21、我们平台上显示的电子竞技赛事的开赛日期及时间仅作参考，不保证一定准确。如果一场比赛提供的日期和/或时间不正确，下单仍然有效。</p>\r\n            <p>22、如果所列赛事不正确，下单将视为无效。</p>\r\n            <p>23、如果比赛被取消、延迟或中断，并且未在原定的开赛时间24小时内重新开赛，则该比赛的所有下单视为无效并退还竞猜币。本规则的例外情况：不管比赛是否暂停或延期，有关一支队伍/选手能否在锦标赛中晋级或夺冠的下单仍然有效。</p>\r\n            <p>24、不明确开赛时间-如果比赛未能确定能在预设开赛时间的12小时内进行，所有下单将视为无效。</p>\r\n            <p>25、如果因掉线或类似原因导致某一局比赛重赛，那么有关这一局的所有已有明确赛果的下单将持续有效。而那些无明确赛果的下单将视为无效，包括受该局影响（情况/经济/比例）的全场订单，并且重新进行的赛事或地图将被视为单独的另一局比赛。</p>\r\n            <p>26、串关里的订单，如被取消，比例按“1”计算</p>\r\n            <p>27、所有比例都会随时变动，递交的下单会按照下单被确认时的比例进行处理。</p>\r\n            <p>28、如果比赛的回合数/地图规定的数目不符合预测标题所显示的赛制数目，则全场让分预测和总分预测下单取消。获胜者预测（及其他有赛果）的下单将继续有效。</p>\r\n            <p>29、开心电竞保留在任何时间暂停预测和/或取消任何下单的权利。一旦预测被暂停，系统将拒绝接收该预测的所有下单。开心电竞保留在不提前通知客户的情况下，停止任何一场比赛开启预测的权利。</p>\r\n            <p>30、如果一个队员/队伍在比赛开始前给出至少一个地图的轻易获胜，所有下单在该赛事的订单将被视为无效，除非这个优势在该下单市场已经很明显。</p>\r\n            <p>31、在一支队伍有一张或者一张以上的地图优势，例如来自于胜者组决赛而具备优势，“地图一”意指实际进行游戏的第一张地图，“地图二”意指实际进行游戏的第二张地图，以此类推。</p>\r\n            <p>32、错误赛事-如果在一项电竞赛事中报出不正确的队员或队伍，则全部下单将计为无效，且开心电竞对此具有单方面绝对酌情权。</p>\r\n            <p>33、错误预测-如果我们当时的比例中有明显的错误，信息输入或建立下单市场时有明显的错误或遗漏不管是由于人为错误或系统问题，比例在下单时,与一般市场行情相差甚远或者做出下单之时发生的事件明显不合情理，则对于该预测的下单将为无效；其他预测也可能被视为无效,且开心电竞对此具有单方面酌情权。</p>\r\n            <p>34、延迟下单（事后单）-赛前下单如果由于任何原因在比赛开始后被接受，该情况下的下单将视为事后单处理。进行中游戏的预测若未能在特定时间前关闭，下单于该时间后的订单将视为事后单处理。</p>\r\n            <p>35、若遇到任何技术上的失误以及任何关于比例更新的延误、终止或赛事关闭预测，任何在赛事已经发生或赛果已经知道后所接受的下单，我们均会视作无效并退回下单项。</p>\r\n            <p>36、对于没有提供进行中游戏的赛事，在预定时间前开赛的比赛，将由开心电竞商议后决定取消订单的时间范围。</p>\r\n            <p>37、如果某选手/队伍在赛事开始前退赛，取消资格或在比赛中退出。则有关该选手/队伍在剩余局数下单均视为无效且夺冠或赛事晋级的下单将被取消，并退还竞猜币。</p>\r\n            <p>38、若遇到特殊情况，如赛事无法确认是否进行或需确认队伍有变动、更改等无法立即结算的情况，开心电竞将保留下单的“待结算”的状态，等候官方信息之后再结算比赛，若12小时后官方无法提供有力的信息，将由开心电竞商议后结算或是取消该赛订单。</p>\r\n            <p>39、对于确认已完成的赛事，但无法获得官方提供正确的赛果，将由开心电竞商议后36小时内进行结算或是取消该赛订单。</p>\r\n            <p>40、比例是根据相关赛程指定队员/队伍而定，在一场赛事中对手改变或对阵与我们显示的赛程不正确的话，那么所有下单均会视作无效。</p>\r\n            <p>41、若发生系统/技术错误，导致开出一个明显错误的比例，则全部下单将计为无效。若错误发生在进行中游戏下单预测上，我们保留权利判断下单无效，本金归还。</p>\r\n            <p>42、我们的系统或程序出错或出现故障时，所有下单将视为无效。您有义务在发现错误时通知我们。</p>\r\n
